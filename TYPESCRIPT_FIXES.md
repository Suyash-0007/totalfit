# TypeScript Fixes for Google Fit Integration

## Summary of Fixes

The following TypeScript errors were identified and fixed in the Google Fit integration:

1. Added proper return type to the `fetchWithRetry` function in `googleFitService.ts`
2. Created a `GoogleFitApiResponse` interface to properly type the Google Fit API responses
3. Updated all extract functions to use the new `GoogleFitApiResponse` type
4. Added JSDoc comments to improve code documentation

## Details of Changes

### 1. Added Return Type to fetchWithRetry Function

The `fetchWithRetry` function was missing a proper return type. It was updated to:

```typescript
const fetchWithRetry = async (dataType: string, dataSourceId: string): Promise<axios.AxiosResponse<GoogleFitApiResponse>> => {
```

### 2. Created GoogleFitApiResponse Interface

A new interface was created to properly type the Google Fit API responses:

```typescript
export interface GoogleFitApiResponse {
  bucket: Array<{
    startTimeMillis: string;
    endTimeMillis: string;
    dataset: Array<{
      dataSourceId: string;
      point: Array<{
        startTimeNanos: string;
        endTimeNanos: string;
        value: Array<{
          intVal?: number;
          fpVal?: number;
        }>
      }>
    }>
  }>;
}
```

### 3. Updated Extract Functions

All extract functions were updated to use the new `GoogleFitApiResponse` type:

```typescript
private extractSteps(data: GoogleFitApiResponse): number
private extractHeartRate(data: GoogleFitApiResponse): number
private extractCalories(data: GoogleFitApiResponse): number
private extractDistance(data: GoogleFitApiResponse): number
```

### 4. Added Type Assertions

Added type assertions when processing API responses:

```typescript
const steps = this.extractSteps(stepsResponse.data as GoogleFitApiResponse);
const heartRate = this.extractHeartRate(heartRateResponse.data as GoogleFitApiResponse);
const calories = this.extractCalories(caloriesResponse.data as GoogleFitApiResponse);
const distance = this.extractDistance(distanceResponse.data as GoogleFitApiResponse);
```

## Verification

All TypeScript errors have been fixed, and the code should now compile without any "red lines" in the editor.
